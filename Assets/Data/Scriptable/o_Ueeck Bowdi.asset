    forcedText: Hello! I also have a problem with my sword. I won't tell you exactly
      what to do with it, because it's your job to decide, but know that it is slightly
      too heavy for me in that state! Some people around here can be a little cryptic
      about what they need. Your work doesn't have to be perfect, but the closer
      you are to their expectations, the higher their chance of survival and the
      closer you get to winning the war!
