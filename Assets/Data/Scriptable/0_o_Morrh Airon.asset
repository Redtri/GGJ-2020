    forcedText: Hey! I'm your first visitor? Everyone who comes here has got a problem
      with ONE piece of equipment only. The rest is fine. Mine is with my sword.
      I have two pieces of iron assigned to it. Can you see it, down the screen?
      I would like you to assign more iron to it, with a left click of your hammer.
      You can retrieve iron with a right click. When it's done, validate in the bottom
      right corner!
